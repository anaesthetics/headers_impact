# âš½ Football Header Impact Classifier

This web app predicts whether a football header impact is **High** or **Low** based on 5 binary questions derived from video footage.  
It uses machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, XGBoost) trained on labeled data (PLA or PAA median split).

Built with **Streamlit**, ready for local use or deployment on [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud).

## ðŸ“¥ Features used (Binary Questions)

| Feature Code                     | Question                                                        |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Q1_BallOver35m_Before`         | Does the ball travel more than 35 meters before the header?     |
| `Q2_FastBall_Before`            | Is the ball velocity high before the header?                    |
| `Q3_DirectionChange_After`      | Is there a change in direction after the header?                |
| `Q4_BallOver10m_After`          | Does the ball travel more than 10 meters after the header?      |
| `Q5_Header_FlickedOrGlanced`    | Is the header flicked or glanced?                               |

Each is entered as "Yes" or "No" by the user in the app.

## ðŸ§  Targets

You can choose between two binary classification targets:

- `PLA (Based on Median)`
- `PAA (Based on Median)`

These should be precomputed in your CSV as categorical values: `"Low"` or `"High"` (e.g., based on median threshold of continuous values).

---

## ðŸ“Š How the app works

1. You select:
   - A model (`RandomForest`, `SVM`, etc.)
   - A target label (`PLA` or `PAA`)
   - A prediction threshold (e.g., 0.5)

2. You answer 5 binary questions (Yes/No)

3. The app computes the predicted probability and compares it to the threshold:
   - If **proba > threshold** â†’ prediction = `High`
   - Else â†’ prediction = `Low`
