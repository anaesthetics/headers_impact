- **Q1**: Did the ball travel more than half the field (~35m) before being headed?
- **Q2**: Was the ball moving fast before the header? (e.g., driven vs floated)
- **Q3**: Did the direction of the ball clearly change after the header?
- **Q4**: Did the ball travel more than 10 meters after the header?
- **Q5**: Was it a flicked/glanced header (vs. a solid direction-changing one)?
