    ## High/Low Force Classification - Impact Characteristics
    
    ### BEFORE HEADER:
    
    **Q1 - Distance Ball Travels BEFORE Header**
    - **Question**: Does the ball travel MORE than 35 metres BEFORE it is headed?
    - **Guide**: Use half the pitch as your guide (does the ball travel more than half the length of the pitch?)
    - **Note**: The distance includes any bounces and/or deflections (e.g., if the ball travels ~20/25 metres in the air before bouncing a further ~10/15 metres without interference before being headed, it has travelled more than 35 metres)
    
    **Q2 - Flight Course of the Ball BEFORE Header**
    - **Question**: Is the velocity (directed speed and acceleration) of the ball high AFTER it has been kicked/thrown?
    - **Consider**: Factors that affect acceleration/speed after the ball has been kicked or headed before the header itself (e.g., does the ball bounce several times which may reduce speed/acceleration? Is there a deflection that changes the speed/acceleration?)
    - **Note**: Consider the type of ball delivery - speed/acceleration following a lofted/floated pass is likely different than following a driven pass/cross
    
    ### AFTER HEADER:
    
    **Q3 - Flight Course of the Ball AFTER Header**
    - **Question**: Is there a change in the motion/direction that the ball is travelling in AFTER it has been headed?
    - **Consider**: Does the direction or motion change after the header? (e.g., ball travels back towards goalkeeper after a header from a goal kick vs. little-to-no change in direction for a flick/glance)
    
    **Q4 - Distance the Ball Travels AFTER Header**
    - **Question**: Does the ball travel MORE than 10 metres AFTER it has been headed?
    - **Guide**: Use the distance between the goal and penalty spot (12 yards = ~10 metres) as your guide
    - **Note**: If the ball is blocked/hits an obstacle, imagine it continuing in the same trajectory to determine if it would have travelled more than 10 metres
    
    **Q5 - Type of Header**
    - **Question**: Is the header flicked on or glanced?
    - **Purpose**: Determine whether the motion/direction of the ball remains unaffected after the header
    - **Note**: This overlaps with Q3 - we want to know if the ball's direction changes, which can be determined by the type of header performed
